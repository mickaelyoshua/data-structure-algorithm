# Sorting
## Pragmatics of Sorting
When having the repeated elements on a set, can be used a secound criteria to sort them. Sometimes is required to leave items in the same relative order as in the original permutation. Sorting algorithms that force this behaviour are called *stable*. Stability can be achieved for any sorting algorithm bya adding the initial position as a secondary key.
