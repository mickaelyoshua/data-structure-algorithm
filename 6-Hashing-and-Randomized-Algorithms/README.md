# Hasing and Randomized Algorithms
Randomized algorithms can be classifyed in two categories:
* **Las Vegas Algorithms**: Guarantee correctness and are usually efficient. Qhicksort is and example of a Las Vegas Algorithm.
* **Monte Carlo Algorithms**: Are efficient and usually produce a correct answer or something close to the correct answer. Representative of this class are random sampling methods.
